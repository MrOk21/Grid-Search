# Grid-Search
This project consist in a grid search applying two different algorithms: A* and Theta*.

Within the repository there are two files that can be launched through the terminal on linux with the following commands: 
- python3 A_star.py 
- python3 Theta_star.py

After launching them, an animation will appear showing the execution of the algorithms.
In animation you can see:
- A*:
  - Start Point = Red
  - End Point = Green
  - Path Color = Blue
  - Nodes Visited = Green
  - Frontier Points = Gray

- Theta*:
  - Start Point = Red
  - End Point = Green   
  - Path Color = Red
  - Nodes Visited = Purple
  - Visibility Points = Yellow
